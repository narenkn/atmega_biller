FIXME:
3. Choice to print words of total bill
4. Print duplicate bill
5. Item, tax total
##7. Add version string in all dat files & check compatible in menu.c
##  7.a Settings file
##  7.b dat file
##  7.c Sale csv
  7.d purchase csv
##8. When start, check billing.csv for proper version and move it to _x.old files if wrong version
9. user wise report
10. Track purchase bills (K20)
11. Seperate purchase reports (K20)
12. Take care of disk full and abort saves.
13. Modify bills easily
##14. CAPITALIZE product code & item name, so to make search ignore case
15. Refund item
16. Limit max items for different versions of product
  a. Product 1K
    1,000 items : EEPROM  56K
    Indexing    : (4*2*1K) 8K
    Total       :         64K (1 EEPROM)
  b. Product 5K
    5,000 items : EEPROM 280K
    Indexing    :(4*2*5K) 40K
    Total       :        320K (5 EEPROM)
  c. Product 30K
    30,000 items : EEPROM 1680K (20 EEPROM)
    Indexing    :(4*2*30K) 240K
    Total       :         1920K (20 EEPROM)
##17. Super user name should be admin & can't be overrided
18. Show stock status (medical)
19. Provision for batch name (all other parameters may change as well)
20. Check all main routines for enable of interrupts/keyboard interrupts.
##21. Check user name is unique before accepting
22. Print result of self diagnosis/tests
23. Show print configurations
   Max Items, Max Bills, version string, device serial number
##24. have serial number for devices
##25. Identify capability of devices from serial number
26. Self Program via SD card
27. EEPROM status for cold-reset-initialized or not
##28. Configuration bit to buzz on keypress : default ON
29. Support 3" printer for 20K product
30. Use EEPROM to store recent bills (or have a copy of last bill)
31. Ability to generate serial number and program it to chip
##32. Before doing any disk operations, make sure disk is present..
##    if (DS_DEV_INVALID != (devStatus & DS_DEV_INVALID))
--33. Mark certain bills invalid (choose invalid mode)
--34. Mark previous bill invalid
35. Have short cuts for menu actions (make previous bill invalid)
##36. Code weighing machine isr routine
37. Send sale data through serial/USB port
38. Store default bill in EEPROM, print in diagnosis.
##39. Check for name/ prod-code in item before accepting it
40. Make sure no two items have same name & prod-code : is this required?
41. Show bill : Need to provide facility to enter bill id
42. LEFT takes back. We introduced ESCAPE, so that needs to be factored in!
43. Number of bill should be rechecked on every bill item. On reset, it needs to be initialized.
44. In Atmega128p device use CLKPR register to scale down clock frequency if necessary

Atmega32 Product:
##1. Change to storing bill in EEPROM
##2. When bill read from memory, check both CRC & (CRC==~INVERT_CRC) for checking validity.
##3. menuDelAllBill : implement optional date & id
4. Make items download from computer
5. Make self diagnosis program
##6. If reached all items in continuous search, break and report no items
