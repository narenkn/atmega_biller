# ATMEGA128 Billing Machine
Documentation at [website](https://narenkn.com/works/embedded/at128_biller/).

This branch _atmega128_no_eeprom_ should be kept in sync with _atmega128_ branch. The only difference should be both items and bills are stored in Non-Volatile Flash in this branch, whereas items is stored in I2C EEPROMs in the other.
